## Big Goal
The most important goals for humans today are:
- create an AI (learn, think, build, r&d)
- try to put our mind in computer (gradually replace parts of our brain with electronic implants)

This gives us (or standalone AI, if we fail at `mind > computer` transition) more working memory, higher processor speed, no need to sleep.
Then we/AI should:
- explore universe using new capabilities
- try to get out of this universe

## Artificial Intelligence
There are 3 topics I'm researching in AI field:
- [Standalone AI](standalone-ai) Computer models that trys to be intelligent
- [mind > computer](mind-to-computer) transition. Tryna move human consciousness from biological/protein hardware to computer/silicon
- [Brain Tools](brain-tools) Tools increasing intelligence without brain surgery
