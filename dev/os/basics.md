OS is a software abstraction layer between hardware and applictions that manages hardware resources and gives beautiful interface to it.

### Kernel

Kernel is the core of OS. 
* Kernel has complete control over everything in the OS
* It is the first program loaded on start-up
* It handles input/output requests from apps, translating them into instructions for CPU. 
* It handles memory and hardware like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.

### System Calls
System calls are a concept that represent actions that processes can ask the kernel to perform.

System call is a concept, a sequence of action performed by the kernel to offer a service to a user process.
