# Terminal.app vs iTerm
## Terminal.app
+ very low typing latency

## iTerm2
+ powerlevel9k theme icons works properly
+ `tmux -CC` integration
+ very convinient way to split panes (horizontal and vertical) with ⌘D and ⌘⇧D
+ open files, folders and links with ⌘+click
    + Terminal.app can open only links
